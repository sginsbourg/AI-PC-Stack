A multi-agent application can run on a single Windows PC, but because it is a distributed system, it will still require specific software and tools to manage the agents, communication, and data.  
Since your domain is **Performance & Load Testing** and the core language is **Node.js**, here is the required infrastructure, categorized by function, to create and run the multi-agent application on a Windows PC.

## **1\. Core Development & Runtime Environment**

| Component | Purpose | Recommended Tool/Software |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Operating System** | The host environment for development and execution. | **Windows 10/11 Professional** or **Windows Server**. |
| **Node.js Runtime** | The engine to execute the agents' code. | **Node.js (LTS version)**. |
| **Code Editor** | For writing and debugging the agents. | **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** (highly integrated with Node.js). |
| **Package Manager** | To manage dependencies for all Node.js agents. | **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js) or **Yarn**. |

## **2\. Agent Orchestration & Isolation**

While you can technically run all agents as separate Node.js processes, containerization is the best practice for isolating agents and simulating a distributed environment, even on one machine.

| Component | Purpose | Recommended Tool/Software |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Containerization** | To package each agent (Generator, Runner, Analyzer, etc.) into its own isolated environment for modularity. | **Docker Desktop** (must be installed on Windows). |
| **Orchestration** | To manage the inter-agent workflow and communication logic. | A Node.js agent framework like **LangChain.js** or a custom **Express.js** service acting as the central Orchestrator/Supervisor. |
| **API/Web Server** | To serve as the entry point for user interaction and for agents to expose internal APIs. | **Express.js** (for creating internal communication endpoints). |

## **3\. Communication & Messaging**

Agents need a reliable way to communicate without blocking each other.

| Component | Purpose | Recommended Tool/Software |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Message Broker** | For asynchronous communication, task queuing, and coordination among agents (e.g., Runner Agent notifies Analysis Agent that the test is complete). | **RabbitMQ** or **Redis** (both can be easily run locally via a single Docker container). |
| **Inter-Process Comm.** | For fast, synchronous communication between agents or for the Orchestrator to route requests. | **HTTP/REST APIs** implemented using **Express.js** or **gRPC** (for higher performance inter-service calls). |

## **4\. Data Storage & Tools**

The system requires several types of storage for different purposes:

| Component | Purpose | Recommended Tool/Software |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Database** | To store structured configuration, test metadata, and long-term agent memory. | **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** (run in a Docker container). |
| **Vector Store** | To give agents a **knowledge base** for tasks like interpreting requirements or analyzing unstructured log data. | **ChromaDB** or **Pinecone** (local instance or free tier for development). |
| **File Storage** | To store test artifacts: generated scripts (e.g., Locust files) and raw results (e.g., CSV/JSON output). | **Local File System** or a local **MinIO** instance (S3-compatible storage in a container). |
| **Load Testing Tool** | The actual software that the **Load Manager Agent** will control to generate the load. | **Locust** (Python-based, but controlled via its API from Node.js) or **k6** (native Node.js support). |

## **5\. Monitoring & Observability**

This is critical for a performance testing application to manage and audit results.

| Component | Purpose | Recommended Tool/Software |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Metrics Collector** | To collect and store time-series metrics from the SUT and the agents themselves. | **Prometheus** (run in a Docker container). |
| **Visualization** | To display performance data, agent activity, and bottlenecks. | **Grafana** (pairs well with Prometheus, run in a Docker container). |
| **Debugging** | To debug the agents' code logic. | **Node.js built-in debugging tools** integrated with **VS Code**. |
